Targets to be achieved in this project

- prompt for filename : file will be csv in the same directory as script
- read the file and parse the contained data into an object structure appropriate for containing table data
- after data is parsed, the script needs to connect with a local mysql database to run some queries

queries
-------

- first query will be to create a table in the database with the same name(minus the extension)
  and structure as the csv file if the table doesn't already exists.

- if it does exist, abort the import and log the existence conflict to the user.
